## Overview

`opendatasus` is an user-friendly R package designed for downloading and processing data from the [DATASUS](https://datasus.saude.gov.br/)'s [openDataSUS platform](https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br).

## Prerequisites

To use the main functions of `opendatasus`, some familiarity with the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) is required.

If you are not comfortable with R, we strongly recommend checking out Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's free online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), as well as the Coursera course [Data Science: Foundations using R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) from John Hopkins University.

## Installation

You can install `opendatasus` using:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("danielvartan/opendatasus")
```

## Usage

We're working on new API functions to make it easier to access the data available on the openDataSUS platform. You can find a list of available functions [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/opendatasus/reference/index.html).

Example of use:

```{r}
library(opendatasus)

fetch_demas_sisvan(uf = "SP") |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

If you use `opendatasus` in your research, please consider citing it. We have put a lot of work into building and maintaining this free and open-source R package. The citation can be found below.
